A minimal readline with multiline and async support.

Inspired by `rustyline` , `async-readline` & `termion-async-input`. Built using `crossterm`

## Features

 * Works on all platforms supported by `crossterm`.
 * Full Unicode Support (Including Graphene Clusters)
 * Multiline Editing
 * In-memory History
 * Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D are returned as `Ok(Interrupt)` and `Ok(Eof)` `ReadlineEvent`s.
 * Ctrl-U to clear line before cursor
 * Ctrl-left & right to move to next or previous whitespace
 * Home/Ctrl-A and End/Ctrl-E to jump to the start and end of the input (Ctrl-A & Ctrl-E can be toggled off with feature)
 * Ctrl-L clear screen
 * Ctrl-W delete until previous space
 * Extensible design based on `crossterm`'s `event-stream` feature

Feel free to PR to add more features!
